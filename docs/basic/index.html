						<h1>Basic page example (h1)</h1>
						<p>The page heading communicates the main focus of the page. Make your page heading descriptive and keep it succinct.</p>
						<p>These headings introduce, respectively, sections and subsections within your body copy. As you create these headings, follow the same guidelines that you use when writing section headings: Be succinct, descriptive, and precise.</p>
						<h2>Subsection heading (h2)</h2>
						<p>The particulars of your body copy will be determined by the topic of your page. Regardless of topic, it’s a good practice to follow the inverted pyramid structure when writing copy: Begin with the information that’s most important to your users and then present information of less importance.</p>
						<p>Keep each section and subsection focused — a good approach is to include one theme (topic) per section.</p>
						<h3>Subsection heading (h3)</h3>
						<p>Use the side navigation menu to help your users quickly skip to different sections of your page. The menu is best suited to displaying a hierarchy with one to three levels and, as we mentioned, to display the sub-navigation of a given page.</p>
